        			<h3 class="title">First Step - prepare the project</h3>
			 		<p class="subtitle">First, you have to find the right language for your project. As an example, it doesn't make sence
						to use python if you want to prepare an android app. So find the right language. Then think about your goal clearly and 
						think about, who could use your project and why. Then you have to create a detailed projects plan including a timeline and a list of tasks. 
						As the fourth step you have to instgall the right tools and (if needed ) learn a new language or framework. 
					</p>
    			</div>
				<div class="Box">
        			<h3 class="title">Second step - coding </h3>

						 Then add comment to your code, so taht others can review your code. Another keypoint is, you have to find your design, 
						it doesn't make sensce, that while you are programming, you are experiementing with the design of your project.</p>
    			</div>
				<div class="Box">
        			<h3 class="title">Third step - prepare relase</h3>
			 		<p class="subtitle">As the last keypoint, you have to write some tests, to find bugs and errors in your code, before you release your code on gIhtub maybe. 
						Another point is that you have to write a documentation about your code, this will help the users to understand your project more clearly. 
					</p>
    			</div>
				<div class="Box">
        			<h3 class="title">Thanks for reading !</h3>
